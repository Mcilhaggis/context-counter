# Count with UseContext and useReducer
`
This project is an exercise in utilizing both UseReducer and UseContext to create a functional component based application. The application allows the user to add digits to a number starting at 0 and clear, storing its state in a global Context Provider. The functionality is also stored in the global state using a switch case nested in useReducer to determine the chosen user action.
